# Story Points

The reason for storypoints is to try to load up a Sprint with a fixed amount of effort. The team gets an idea of how much work they can reasonably get done in a certain period of time. The idea is that a Sprint might contain 20 points. The purpose of Sprint Planning is to choose which 40 points are the ones that will get done during that sprint.

Sometimes teams spend a whole Sprint planning meeting dicussing story points for each issue. They even do something called Planning Poker. Let's not do that. It's boring and estimates are always wrong whether or not you spend all day doing them

So as a shortcut, I we could the following and just see what happens

1 point: Something quite trivial I can generally get done before lunch
3 points: Something a bit more in depth which might take a day or even a bit more
5 points: A bigger piece of work which may span days

Story points are not something to get hung up on. It's the kind of thing that Project Managers use to justify their existance, but are slightly less useful to developers
