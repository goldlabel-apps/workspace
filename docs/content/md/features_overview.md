## Features 

Organising React Apps into features is something I've seen recently when changing my Redux pattern to [redux-toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/). The idea is that all the indiviual parts pertaining to that particular features are collected together into a single directory which is made as easy as possible to integrate with any React app. Perhaps these Features could be implemented as packages, standalone. Or even [SingleSPA](https://single-spa.js.org/)'s. Whatever the implemetation, the idea is to make it as easy as possible to add and remove features to any given React project
